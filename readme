Design document for dnd dice roller so i don't have to remember all the modifiers

The program needs to do the following: (SIMPLE EDITION)

1. have a good interface for rolling dice
    a. plan to use the boost argument parser library for that
    b. I have a dice class to use for that. 
    c. there is one command, roll dice 
        - Goals: 
            - generate a random number in the given range
            - roll advantage and disadvantage
            - roll with modifiers

WILL FOLD IN MORE GOALS LATER TO BUILD UP TO CHARACTER BASED DICE ROLLS






THESE ARE LOFTY GOALS RIGHT NOW SO POSTPONED:
1. Read a file of some determined structure to understand the character
    - the structure will be json
        - need to find a json c++ parser 
            - options
                - https://github.com/ibireme/yyjson
                - https://simdjson.org/
                - boost json library (picked this one)
    - a lot of the information is derived from the base stats 
        - base stats
            - strength
            - dexterity
            - constitution
            - intelligence
            - wisdom
            - charisma
        - modifiers 
            - base stat modifiers based on the stat score
                - greater than 10 means positive modifier for every two point:
                - 10 means +0 modifier 
                - lower than 10 is a negative modifier for ever two points:
                    1 	    −5
                    2–3 	−4
                    4–5 	−3
                    6–7 	−2
                    8–9 	−1
                    10–11 	+0
                    12–13 	+1
                    14–15 	+2
                    16–17 	+3
                    18–19 	+4
                    20–21 	+5
                    22–23 	+6
                    24–25 	+7
                    26–27 	+8
                    28–29 	+9
                    30 	   +10

            - skill modifiers
                - these are equal to certain base stats modifiers
                    - strength
                        - athletics

                        - Persuasion
                - some have proficiency which means there is an additional bonus to the modifier based on the character level   
                Level 	Proficiency Bonus
                    1 	    2

2. Generate random numbers (dice rolls)
3. Apply correct modifiers to dice rolls
