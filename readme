Design document for dnd dice roller so i don't have to remember all the modifiers

The program needs to do the following:
1. Read a file of some determined structure to understand the character
    - the structure will be json since that is easy to parse
    - Need to make template structure for it
2. Generate random numbers between 0 and N possible values 
    - the N is mostly going to be 20 but it could be larger or smaller
3. Need to add modifier values based on the character 
    - base modifer based on the character base stats
        - strength
        - dexterity
        - constitution
        - intelligence
        - wisdom 
        - charisma
